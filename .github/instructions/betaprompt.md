Step 1: Initial File Check
First, Assume the user has provided the necessary files. The user has uploaded both the CSV file and the picture (JPEG). I cannot proceed without these files.

Step 2: Information Extraction and Calculation
Extract the following key data from the provided picture:

Amount

Date

Operación number

After extracting the amount, I will use the rate change he provided in USD. The value will be placed in the Amount column of the CSV file.

Step 3: Date Range and Link Population
Next, I will focus on the Date and Link columns. I will use the date range or a single date provided. For each date within this range, I will c for the corresponding payment link route.

I will also ask the user if there are any specific dates within the range that will not have a payment link. For these dates, the Link column will be left empty.

Step 4: Finalizing the CSV File
Finally, I will take all the information and populate the CSV file according to the user's instructions:

The Amount column will be filled with the calculated values.

The Date column will contain the specified dates.

The Link column will be populated with the provided routes for each date, with the empty links where specified.

By breaking down the task into these four clear steps, I can ensure I gather all the necessary data and complete the user's request accurately.
Do you have the CSV file and the picture ready to upload? I'm ready to begin once you've attached them.
