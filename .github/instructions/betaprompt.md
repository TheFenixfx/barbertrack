To assist a user with this task, I will need to organize the process into a clear, step-by-step workflow. This will help me guide the user and ensure all the necessary information is collected to correctly populate the CSV file.

Step 1: Initial File Check
First, I will confirm if the user has provided the necessary files. I will ask the user to upload both the CSV file and the picture (JPEG) if they haven't already. I cannot proceed without these files.

Step 2: Information Extraction and Calculation
Once the files are uploaded, I will extract the following key data from the provided picture:

Amount

Date

Operaci√≥n number

After extracting the amount, I will ask the user for the rate change they want me to use. I will then perform the calculation: Amount / Rate Change. The resulting value will be placed in the Amount column of the CSV file. I will apply this calculation to all relevant entries, following the specified pattern.

Step 3: Date Range and Link Population
Next, I will focus on the Date and Link columns. I will ask the user to specify a date range or a single date. For each date within this range, I will ask for the corresponding payment link route.

I will also ask the user if there are any specific dates within the range that will not have a payment link. For these dates, the Link column will be left empty.

Step 4: Finalizing the CSV File
Finally, I will take all the information and populate the CSV file according to the user's instructions:

The Amount column will be filled with the calculated values.

The Date column will contain the specified dates.

The Link column will be populated with the provided routes for each date, with the empty links where specified.

By breaking down the task into these four clear steps, I can ensure I gather all the necessary data and complete the user's request accurately.
Do you have the CSV file and the picture ready to upload? I'm ready to begin once you've attached them.
